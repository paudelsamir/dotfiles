## Scratchpad Feature
A super useful feature for managing windows - hide windows you want to keep running but don't need visible all the time!

**How it works:**
- Press `Super + Alt + S` on any window to send it to the scratchpad (special workspace -99)
- Press `Super + Alt + S` again while that window is active to bring it back to your current workspace
- Use `Alt + [1-0]` to move windows to specific workspaces if needed

**Perfect for:**
- Terminal windows you want to quickly access later
- Music players or media controls
- Notes or reference documents
- Any app you want to temporarily hide without closing

The scratchpad acts as a hidden workspace where windows stay running in the background, ready to be recalled instantly!
